# LibSensorsD3CM10
Backup of final compilation + edits for sensors HAL Library for Droid 3 for use with CM10

This is setup to be basically pasted over the cm10 android repo. It makes necessary custom sensors.solana.so and adds kernel patch
for x-y axis switch

This code is no longer necessary as it was merged into
https://github.com/STS-Dev-Team/android_device_motorola_solana
and 
https://github.com/STS-Dev-Team/kernel_mapphone_kexec 

Which are used to make offical cm10 builds
